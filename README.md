It takes a lot of effort to create something as magnifgicient as this; I mean think about it... not very many people spend their monday nights attempting different approaches to the perfect Calculator. Well neither did I!

I decided to create an ordinary Calculator with problems.

Anyways!

Welcome to my Python Calculator. (Probably has issues here n there)

Regardless of if your the teacher marking this or just someone looking to copy n paste a coding masterpeice, I hope you enjoy every bit of this assignment as much as I did.

Thank you!!
